‚û° By pressing the **LOAD** button, all the materials in the mtl file are loaded and spawned in a list. (The example mtl file only contains one material)

‚û° We can view each material in the preview section or have a look at its properties in the properties section.

‚û° We can also open the Material Console by pressing the **CONSOLE** button to see the logs and errors for each material in the mtl file.

‚û° We can change the values of the properties in the properties editor. (In this example we fix the absolute path to the diffuse texture file to relative path)

‚û° After we are done with editing the properties of each material in the file, we can press the **SAVE** button to save the changes to the disk and update the preview.
